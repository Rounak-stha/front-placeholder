## FrontEnd Placeholder

### About

This project was initially started to test out the app-dir feature of Nextjs 13. So, the ui takes inspiration from [here](app-dir.vercel.app).
Now the project is used as a testing ground for lerning new library or just as a placeholder to some code to be used later.

## Issues

See the [open issues](https://github.com/Rounak-stha/Github-Search-Simplified/issues) for a full list of proposed features (and known issues).
